# 2025 Snow Farm GPS Project

## Overview
Welcome to the 2025 Snow Farm GPS Project! We're building a reliable, low-cost GNSS-IR system to monitor environmental changes at Snow Farm, Cardrona, NZ. This student-driven project is supported by local experts and aims to create a robust setup for real-time environmental data collection.

Last year, we installed antennas and began data collection. In 2025, weâ€™ll refine our systems across specialized teams:

- **Electronics & Programming**: Build and program the GPS hardware.
- **Data Science**: Analyze GNSS-IR data using Python.
- **Science**: Validate and interpret GNSS-IR data.
- **Physics**: Design power systems for harsh conditions.
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Create durable enclosures.
- **Web Applications**: Build an API and website for data visualization.

## What is GNSS-IR?
GNSS-IR (Global Navigation Satellite System - Interferometric Reflectometry) uses reflected satellite signals to study environmental surfaces like snow, water, or soil. It provides insights into snow depth, sea level changes, and more, transforming standard GPS tools into environmental monitoring devices.

## Goals
By the end of 2025, we aim to have:
- A fully functional GNSS-IR system operating at Snow Farm.
- Real-time data collection stored and visualized on a cloud platform.
- Students mastering technical and scientific concepts.

Join us in building, learning, and exploring!
